EXTD=ELVIS PRESLEY - ELV1S 30 #1 Hits\n\n(2002)\n\n-- liner notes --\n\n(front cover)\n\nThe front cover consists entirely of a gold-tone background with the word "ELV1S" \nspanning roughly 80 percent of the width of the cover, centered horizontally and
EXTD=\nvertically on the page.  The bodies of the letters (E, L, V, and S) are fashioned using \nsmall round white dots in widths of three dots or more.  The number "1" is a solid black \ncharacter in a very computeristic typeface (much like the numbers y
EXTD=ou find on the bottom \nof most bank checks for optical character recognition).  Below the right half of the word \n("ELV1S") is the phrase "30 #1 HITS" in a very thin and squarish font with the letters \nreaching no more than 1/10 of an inch in heig
EXTD=ht, colored in black.\n\n\n(pages 2 & 3)\n\nSpanning the first two inside pages is a photograph of a Gibson acoustic (or maybe \nacoustic-electric) guitar with mother of pearl inlayed in the finger board spelling out \n"ELVIS PRESLEY" (with a star on
EXTD= each end) in a distinctly old-west (or country) \ntypeface.  The guitar lays horizontally face-up with the neck end on the right hand page.  \nStraddling the guitar neck (above and below) is the track list.\n\nTrack list:\n\n     01 heartbreak hotel

EXTD=icting Elvis (on the right) singing into a 50's or 60's era stage or studio \nmicrophone.  He is wearing a suit (color cannot be determined because the photo is in \nblack and white (or brown-tone)) and has a guitar suspended by a strap around his ne
EXTD=ck.  \nIt seems that his eyes are closed, and his hands are in a position that indicates he may \nhave just let go of the guitar.  On the left is a shiny new television camera (of the same \nvintage as the microphone) decorated with the CBS logo of t
EXTD=hat era.\n\nCrossing the left page and about 40 percent of the right page (but not covering the \nmicrophone or Elvis) is the quote: "I DON'T SOUND LIKE NOBODY." (See Peter \nGuralnick's comments from page 6, below.)\n\n\n(pages 6 & 7)\n\nThe backgro
EXTD=und for page 6 is a photograph of someone (apparently Elvis) from below the \nshoulders down.  It appears that he (whoever is in the photo) is performing and is doing \n(or about to do) the much talked about hip-wag movement that Elvis created.  The
EXTD=person \nin the photo is also holding a guitar on his right side so as not to obstruct the view of his \nbody.\n\nIn large letters covering 80 percent of the page is the quote: \n\n    "RHYTHM IS\n     SOMETHING YOU\n     EITHER HAVE OREXTD=n     DON
EXTD='T HAVE,\n     BUT WHEN YOU\n     HAVE IT, YOU HAVE\n     IT ALL OVER."\n\nPage 7 consists of a 5-paragraph introduction by Peter Guralnick (see credits, below) as \nfollows:\n\nJust in case there is any lingering doubt, one listen to this album shou
EXTD=ld forever put to rest \nthe question of Elvis' musical significance, cultural impact, and artistic achievement.  \nFrom "Heartbreak Hotel" to "Suspicious Minds," from "Hound Dog" to "Crying In The \nChapel," Elvis' #1 chart hits display a multitude
EXTD=of moods, a variety of styles, and an \nemotional range that defeat any attempt at typecasting or musical categorization.\n\nWho do you sound like? Elvis was asked when he first entered the Sun recording studio \nat the age of eighteen.  "I don't sou
EXTD=nd like nobody," he replied.  And in response to the \ninevitable follow-up question as to what kind of music he sang, he simply responded, "I \nsing all kinds."\n\nThat turned out indeed to be the case.  Like so many great actors and singers, Elvis
EXTD=\npossessed the capacity to imitate virtually anybody that he admired - country and western \nsingers like Hank Snow, rhythm and blues performers like Jackie Wilson, crooners like \nBing Crosby, gospel quartet singers like Jake Hess. But in the end h
EXTD=e came out sounding \nlike nobody but himself, whether he was singing a tremulous ballad like "Love Me \nTender" or an all-out rocker like "Jailhouse Rock."  He possessed a gift, in the words \nof Jake Hess, virtuoso lead singer for Elvis' favorite g
EXTD=ospel group, the Statesmen, for \npouring himself into a song, "he just seemed to live every word of it."\n\nSome of the songs on this album are so familiar it can be difficult at times to recall the \nimmediacy of their initial impact.  Some of the
EXTD=pleasure we take in them derives from \nmemory, of course, but I think if we can set aside for a moment the context in which they \nwere first heard, the freshness, the originality, the emotional truth, the sheer fun of them \nwill surely come throug
EXTD=h.\n\nElvis Presley helped usher in a revolution.  He was a true believer in the democratic \ndream, and we continue to be swept up in that same sense of unabashed striving that he \nstood for, that belief in freedom and unlimited possibilities that
EXTD=his music proclaims.\n\n     PETER GURALNICK\n\n\n(page 8)\n\nThis page consists of a collage of 4 images. In the center and foreground is a shiny chromed \nboom microphone with the end of the boom in view overhead.  The left half of the collage is
EXTD=\na retouched photograph of Elvis' head exhibiting one of his serious (nearly expressionless) \nlooks, his hair with the very recognizable waxed-wave appearance and his chin and cheeks \nbaby-bottom smooth.  On the right is an early photo of Elvis on
EXTD= stage in front of a curtain, \nholding a microphone in his right hand with a guitar hanging freely on the strap about his \nneck. It appears he may be sitting on a stool, his eyes are closed, and the viewer is enticed \nto remember the sounds create
EXTD=d by the person depicted in the photo.\n\n\n(pages 9, 10, 11, 13, 15 & 17)\n\nThese pages contain narratives for each of the thirty songs in the album (not including the \nbonus track).  For each song, the release date for the song is given and a sho
EXTD=rt (2 to 5 line) \nhistory about the song (or events surrounding it) is presented.  The content of these \nnarratives is included in the extra track information for each song respectively.\n\nTwo of the pages containing the track narratives (pages 10
EXTD= and 11 specifically) contain \nbackground images consisting of two photographs of Elvis.  The photo on page 10 depicts \nhim in dark colored high-water style jeans, penny loafers and white socks, a horizontally-\nstriped zippered shirt and dark colo
EXTD=red (perhaps leather) jacket.  The background image \non page 11 shows him in a totally gold-metallic suit with gold shoes (one of his well known \ncostumes).  Both images show him only from mid-abdomen, down.\n\n\n(page 12)\n\nThis page is made up o
EXTD=f another collage of images of Elvis.  On the left we see his left hand \nholding a microphone while he is on stage.  On the right we see his face in one of his very \nrecognizable expressions while singing.  In the center is one-half (his right side
EXTD=) of a photo \ntaken while he was in the military service.  He is shown in a dress uniform with dress cap, \ncoat and tie.\n\n\n(page 14)\n\nThe quote: "AMBITION IS A DREAM WITH A V8 ENGINE." covers a photograph of Elvis \n(again minus his head and s
EXTD=houlders) wearing matching white shirt and slacks with \nornamental buckles sewn along the seams of both.\n\n\n(page 16)\n\nOnce again we see a collage of three photos.  On the upper left is Elvis (with head visible) \nin one of his wide-cuff-and-col
EXTD=lar outfits holding a microphone in his right hand.  No guitar \nis visible, but a lei (flowered necklace from Hawaii) hangs around his neck.  On the lower \nleft we see a portion of the body of Elvis' guitar, the same one shown on pages 2 & 3.  On
EXTD=\nthe right is another retouched photo of Elvis, nearly expressionless, in gold-tone.\n\n\n(pages 18 & 19)\n\nThese pages present a list of the thirty tracks from the CD giving the track number, name, \nrunning time, writer, publisher, collaborative
EXTD=performers, recording date, and chart statistics.  \nThis information is included with the narratives (discussed earlier) in the extra track \ninformation for each song respectively.\n\nThe background for these two pages is the same gold-tone used fo
EXTD=r the cover.  The \nprinted text is all in white.\n\n\n(page 20)\n\nTo compile a disc of Elvis' number one hits is a musical delight, to limit it to 80 minutes \nis a headache, and to look at the list of didn't-make-its is close to heartache.\n\nWe h
EXTD=ave chosen to select number ones from the official U.S. and U.K. pop charts, and \ndebate on what counts and what doesn't becomes somewhat clouded when comparing \ncompeting charts from Billboard, Cashbox, New Musical Express and Record Retailer.\n\n
EXTD=With further research, even the starting point is open for interpretation.  "That's All Right"/ \n"Blue Moon Of Kentucky" was Elvis' first record for the independent Sun Records label, \nand the b-side was number one in Memphis in September, 1954.  I
EXTD=f charts were available \nfor Gladewater, Texas or Shreveport, Louisiana or Sheffield, Alabama, "That's All Right" \nmight well have turned up at number one in all those places.\n\nThe country chart provided Elvis with 11 number one hits - seven of w
EXTD=hich were also pop \nnumber ones.  "I Forgot To Remember To Forget" hit number one on the Billboard country \nchart two months before "Heartbreak Hotel" did the same on the pop chart.  His other \nnumber ones in the country field were "I Want You, I
EXTD=Need You, I Love You," "Moody \nBlue" and a 1980 remix of "Guitar Man."\n\nElvis' six number ones on the Billboard R&B chart included "Wear My Ring Around Your \nNeck," which "only" reached number three on the pop chart.  "Hound Dog," "Don't Be \nCru
EXTD=el," "All Shook Up," "Teddy Bear" and "Jailhouse Rock" were number one on the pop, \nC&W and R&B charts.\n\nIt wasn't until "All Shook Up" that Elvis got his first U.K. number one.  In England, four of \nElvis' singles became double-sided number ones
EXTD=.  We have chosen to include the U.S. top \nsides for these four in favor of "I Need Your Love Tonight," "I Got Stung," "Little Sister" \nand "Rock-A-Hula Baby."\n\nElvis' reign at the top of the charts takes on an even more spectacular angle when yo
EXTD=u look \nat the number of weeks he spent there.  Elvis claimed the number one spot in the U.S. for \n24 weeks in 1956, only to top that the following year with 26 weeks - half of the year.  He \nmanaged another 15 weeks at number one in 1960, upon hi
EXTD=s return from the army.\n\nAdditional charts from all over the world will undoubtedly reveal many more Elvis number \nones, but at The RCA Records Label we are proud to present, for the first time, 30 U.S. \nand U.K. number one hits in one collection
EXTD= - an unparalleled achievement in music history \nand a wonderful introduction to the ever-fascinating music of Elvis Presley.\n\n     -- Ernst Mikael Jorgensen\n\n\n(pages 21 & 22)\n\nThese pages (the last leaf of the liner notes booklet before the
EXTD=back cover) offer the Elvis \nPresley collector a gamut of products bearing Elvis' name, likeness, and/or music for sale.  \nThere is even an 800 number provided to apply for the "Elvis Presley Platinum Plus(TM) \nVisa credit card."  It would be an i
EXTD=nteresting experiment to try to call the 1-888-ELVISROCKS \nnumber provided for ordering any of the products, although it is doubtful that - even if the \nnumber still works - the advertised prices are still valid this many years hence, but who knows

EXTT0=elease date: January 27, 1956\n\nOne of the most unusual, certainly the most unlikely of Elvis' #1 hits.  The idea came from a \nsuicide note printed in the Miami Herald, and the song, Elvis' first RCA single, was given to \nhim by Florida schooltea
EXTT0=cher/ sometime songwriter and publicist Mae Boren Axton.  It was \nrecorded in Nashville with the intention of replicating the echo effect of Elvis' Sun sides.  It \ndidn't, and RCA almost rejected the result, but the single reached #1 after extensi

EXTT1=. 11 weeks at #1 (with HOUND DOG)\nU.K. peaked at #2\n\nrelease date: July 13, 1956\n\nElvis self-produced for the first time.  Up until this point RCA had continued to cast about for \na suitable approach to recording.  With this session Elvis took
EXTT1= over the reins, creating a new \npop style for himself, a kind of offhand, almost casual feel that he achieved only after pushing \nhimself and the band through twenty-eight exacting takes.
EXTT2=3.  Hound Dog  (2:16)\n\n(Written by Leiber/Stoller)\nPublished by Universal-MCA Music Publishing (ASCAP)/\nGladys Music administered by Chrysalis Music (ASCAP)/\nGladys Music administered by Cherry Lane Music Publishing Company, Inc. (ASCAP)\nWith

EXTT2=d Dog," a 1953 blues classic by Big Mama Thornton which \nhe had picked up from Freddie Bell and the Bell Boys during his April appearance in Las \nVegas, had become a staple of Elvis' live show.  He gave it an altogether different treatment \nin th
EXTT2=e studio, drawing out a hard-driving, machine-gun-like performance from drummer D.J. \nFontana through thirty-one increasingly focused takes.
EXTT3=4.  Love Me Tender  (2:45)\n\n(Written by Presley/Matson)\nPublished by Elvis Presley Music administered by Chrysalis Songs (BMI)/\nElvis Presley Music administered by Cherry River Music Co. (BMI)\nFrom the 20th Century Fox CinemaScope production "L

EXTT3=ilm, a period western, \nand was done in persuasive enough style to change the movie's name.  Its success \nrepresented the fruition of an ambition Elvis had had since first entering the recording \nstudio: to become a ballad singer along the lines

EXTT4=\nRecorded September 2, 1956\nU.S. 3 weeks at #1\nU.K. peaked at #6\n\nrelease date: January 4, 1957\n\nGuitarist Scotty Moore never was able to duplicate his anarchically inspired solo after this \nsession, but that, too, represented the spirit wit
EXTT4=h which Elvis entered the studio: to create \na free and unfettered sound.  He wasn't looking for perfection, just something genuinely \nfresh and unique.
EXTT5=6.  All Shook Up  (2:00)\n\n(Written by Blackwell/Presley)\nPublished by Elvis Presley Music administered by Chrysalis Songs (BMI)/\nElvis Presley Music administered by Cherry River Music Co. (BMI)\nWith The Jordanaires\nRecorded January 12, 1957\nU

EXTT7= who \nwrote much of the soundtrack of this and Elvis' next movie, "King Creole".  The driving \nrhythm was the product of the familiar interplay of guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer D.J. \nFontana, with original "slap" bassist Bill Black on electr
