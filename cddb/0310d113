EXTD=h well. j/k) \n\nAnyway when you have only six albums, your releases can get kind of numbered. So the Manzarek, Densmore, and Krieger release THE VERY BEST OF THE DOORS, which features remixed music drawn from their updated catalogue. In 2007, in cel

EXTD=COM CUSTOMER REVIEW\nGood grief, this is EPIC, October 12, 2007 \nBy  Dazedcat (Earth)\nI guess it depends on your point of view regarding the mixes found on this collection. If you're like me who's actually listened to the Doors for these past forty
