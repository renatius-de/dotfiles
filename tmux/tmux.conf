# Display string to the left of the status bar. string will be passed through

#   Character pair	| Replaced with
#   #(shell-command)	| First line of the command's output
#   #[attributes]	| Colour or attribute change
#   #H			| Hostname of local host
#   #F			| Current window flag

#   #P			| Current pane index
#   #S			| Session name
#   #T			| Current window title
#   #W			| Current window name
#   ##			| A literal ‘#’
#
# The #(shell-command) form executes ‘shell-command’ and inserts the first line
# of its output. Note that shell commands are only executed once at the interval
# specified by the status-interval option: if the status line is redrawn in the
# meantime, the previous result is used. Shell commands are executed with the
# tmux global environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).
#
# The window title (#T) is the title set by the program running within the
# window using the OSC title setting sequence, for example:
#
#	$ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\
#
# When a window is first created, its title is the hostname.

# these may be ‘fg=colour’ to set the foreground colour, ‘bg=colour’ to set the
# background colour, the name of one of the attributes (listed under the
# message-attr option) to turn an attribute on, or an attribute prefixed with
# ‘no’ to turn one off, for example nobold. Examples are:
#	#(sysctl vm.loadavg)
#	#[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]
#
# Where appropriate, special character sequences may be prefixed with a number
# to specify the maximum length, for example ‘#24T’.

#
# For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all

# the option could be set to the string:

#   "*:clear=\e[H\e[2J,rxvt:dch1=\e[P"
#
# The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation.

# support 88 or 256 colours:
#
#   "*88col*:colors=88,*256col*:colors=256"
